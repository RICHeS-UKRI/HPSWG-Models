# Model Consistency Report

_Generated: 2026-03-07 20:55 UTC_

**Individual model files analysed:** 13  
**Workflow/overview files analysed:** 1  

This report checks consistency of inter-model linking nodes declared in each model's `//subgraph Linked Entities` block. Only declared linked entities are checked -- high-multiplicity classes such as E55 type terms are not flagged unless explicitly declared.

## Link declaration syntax

Each linked entity in a model's `//subgraph Linked Entities` block should have a `//links` directive declaring what it connects to. Two target types are supported:

**Repo model targets** -- point to another model folder in this repository:
```
//links E39: Project Owner --> person, institution
//links E7: Parent Project --> project
```

**Ontology references** -- follow standard CRM/extension ontology structure with no bespoke repo model needed:
```
//links E31: Related Documents --> crm:E31
//links E94: Sampling Point --> crmsci:E94
//links D1: Digital Object --> crmdig:D1
```

Multiple targets are comma-separated or joined with `or`.

---

**Status key:**
- ✅ Consistent -- repo model, class codes match exactly
- 🔵 Hierarchy match -- repo model, related via CRM hierarchy, confirm intent
- ⚠️ Class mismatch -- classes not related, check required
- ❓ Unknown target -- declared target folder not found in repo
- 📖 Ontology reference -- follows standard CRM/extension ontology structure
- 📖🔵 Ontology via hierarchy -- related class, confirm intent
- 📖⚠️ Ontology mismatch -- class code does not match reference
- ⚠ No declaration -- `//links` directive missing, suggestions provided

---

## 1. Per-model link validation

Each model's linked entities are listed with their declared target models and consistency status. Where no `//links` declaration exists, possible targets are suggested based on matching class codes.
